# Sprint 1_Month_Class_Project

📄 **Description - Exercise Statement**

This project involves creating a class called `Month` that will represent the months of the year. 
The objective is to manage a list of months using an `ArrayList`, ensuring that "August" is inserted in the correct position. 
The project demonstrates maintaining order in a list and converting it into a `HashSet` to prevent duplicates.

The first step is to define the `Month` class, which includes an attribute for the month name. 
An `ArrayList` will be created to store instances of each month, excluding "August." Once the list is populated, "August" will be added at its proper index.
